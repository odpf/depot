# Roadmap

In the following section, you can learn about what features we're working on, 
what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

Weâ€™re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, 
and we see the potential to engage more in discussions 
about the future of sink connectors.

such as how the issues are presented, 
let us know through [discussions](https://github.com/odpf/depot/discussions).
